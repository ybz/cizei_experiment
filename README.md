# Cizei Experiments

A site that hosts various kinds of my web experiments

Running on Flask and using Grunt for compiling assets

Can be deployed on heroku using a multi-buildpack:
  - python is used to run the backend
  - node is used for grunt
  - ruby is used to fulfil any deps grunt may need such as compass etc.
